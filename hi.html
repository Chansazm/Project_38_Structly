Roblox, the $40 billion gaming platform popular with kids, mentions the metaverse in every job ad.
The California-headquartered firm pays senior tech talent up to $450,000 in base salary, salary data shows.
CTO Daniel Sturman outlined the five key traits candidates need to demonstrate through the hiring process.
Roblox, the gaming platform popular with children, is a firm believer in the metaverse — and it's hiring.

The firm currently has 258 open roles. All job descriptions mention the term metaverse.

The firm lets users make and play games made by other developers, and is wildly popular with young users. The firm has nearly 50 million daily active users. 

What exactly the metaverse is is debated. The term was popularized in late 2021 by Facebook, which rebranded to Meta in October and laid out its vision of a future internet accessed via virtual and augmented reality. 
Epic Games
, the creator of "Fortnite", has also talked up the metaverse as "socially-connected online services."

Roblox's chief technology officer, Daniel Sturman, sees the metaverse building on its existing 3D games, plus virtual events like its concert with Lil Nas X.

"We believe in a platform that's going to bring billions of users together to share 3D experiences, and we've been doing this for over 15 years at this point," he told Insider. "So, it's been a long steady climb in this direction that that's been going pretty well."

He added: "I view my job as to provide the platform to this community, and then let their creativity figure out all the cool things they can do with it." 

Roblox is hiring for a range of roles: front-end engineers, back-end engineers, and full-stack engineers among others. In addition, its also keen on candidates with backgrounds in machine learning, physics, and graphics. 

Sturman said all roles are "geared towards enabling the metaverse experiences."

A software engineer at Roblox can earn between $141,000 and $215,000 in base salary, according to an Insider analysis of US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's disclosure data for permanent and temporary foreign workers in 2021, which shows what companies are willing to pay workers in key roles. 

Insider analysis of updated data in 2022 shows that a senior software engineer can make up to $275,000 whilst a senior engineer - avatar earned $210,000. At executive levels, a director of engineering earned $425,000 and a vice president of social and apps earned $450,000. 

Sturman told Insider that the company is hiring at all levels from "college grads" to "the best in the world,", particularly in San Mateo, California where Roblox's headquarters are located. The company is also hiring for its 2023 summer internship program in July which pays interns nearly $10,000 a month. 

The recruitment process is lengthy. For entry-level positions, candidates send a resume and fill out an application about their motivations. A phone screening is next. They are then invited to complete two tests: one cognitive, one technical. The final round includes two technical interviews, an interview with a manager, and then a senior leader. 

For senior hires, there are two rounds of interviews: a tactical round with three technical interviews and a discussion with a manager. If they pass that, they move onto the executive round and meet the director of the team, and potentially the vice president. 

Roblox has a very high technical bar which sometimes means "we miss good candidates," but Sturman said that it's not just trying to hire as many great technical people as possible. Roblox is a "happy place" and employees are excited to be there so recruiters are always looking for "a great match," culturally.

Sturman broke down five key traits candidates need to impress recruiters and thrive at the company. 

1. Respect goes a long way
Roblox prides itself on having a great community, said Sturman. "People like being here. They like working with their colleagues. It's a great community. Being very egocentric is not really tolerated by peers as well as management."

Recruiters are interested in candidates who are an "overall cultural fit."

"We talk a lot about folks who respect the community, and just remember that our platform is nothing without our developers and our users, so be very focused that you're part of something bigger," said Sturman. "You've got to be comfortable with that it's not all about you." 

2. Long-term thinkers earn long-term roles
Tech companies are often competing to ship products as quickly as possible, but Sturman said Roblox tries to think more long term.

"A big differentiator can be that ability to take a long-term view. I would say that's a place, folks from a lot of other companies sometimes struggle with. They're used to being in an environment where the goal was to get it out as fast as possible.

"We want folks who can demonstrate to us that they're innovative, long-term thinkers, will go to first principles, and not just to do things the way they've been done, but figure out the right solution for us." 

3. Embracing challenges 
Sturman said candidates are often given "open-ended problems," such as how to design something in real life and see how they solve it. This is to observe how "people brainstorm and think about things." 

He added: "We like folks to take initiative, get things done, have some grit, and say: 'This is what I'm trying to get done. If something's in the way I'm going to figure out how to deal with that problem, not hope someone else comes and solves the problem for me.'

"So perseverance is really important, and it's the thing we look at a lot in the interview process, where's the grit? Where's the passion, where's the perseverance of this individual?"

4. A history of strong contributions 
Sturman said Roblox doesn't seek out particular programming languages. Some of its employees are self-taught without formal qualifications — so passion is an important quality in candidates.

Roblox has a range of employees, some without university degrees who are self-taught, so it's important that candidates can show their passion and what they've done, rather than just their skills.

"I think any really strong contributor can find a place in this company," Sturman told Insider.  

"We're more interested in you telling us about a great project you worked on, why it made a difference and why it was hard. We're looking for that, and I think we're broad enough here that if you've just done some impressive things, we can usually find a place to map that into the organization somewhere." 

This could include working at a nonprofit organization at college, and how you might have made a difference doing that.

5. What's your story? 
Having a compelling narrative is another important trait.

"We really want you to be able to tell us your story, we are always very curious about what drives you, where do you think you've made a difference? What's something you're proud of doing? Whether it's in technology or not in technology, again, we're looking for that grit, that passion, that drive. That's important," said Sturman.

"Try to be your best self, we want people who fit into our happy work environment, and folks who are excited about that, and radiate that."
